# CISC 225 - Week 12 Exercises

## Hypotenuse

Write a program that prompts for two double-precision floating point values
representing two sides of a right triangle.
The program should calculate and output the length of the hypotenuse.

## Temperature Conversion

Write a program that inputs a temperature and temperature scale,
either 'f' or 'c', and converts that temperature to the other scale.
(Scales being 'f' for Fahrenheit and 'c' for Celsius.)

Input should be in the form `98.6f` and should accept either
lowercase or uppercase for the scale.
If an invalid scale is provided, the program should simply quietly exit.
